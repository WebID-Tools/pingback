# What is SemPb?

SemPB stands for Semantic Pingback, a serice aiming to let users know that someone has added them as friends in their foaf profiles. In order to receive pingbacks, users should add a 'pingback' relation to their profile: 

<pingback:to
        xmlns:pingback="http://purl.org/net/pingback/"
        rdf:resource="http://your-favorite-pingback-service.com/"
        />

Right now SemPb transmits pings by email, therefore users should also have a valid foaf:mbox relation if they would like to receive pings.

You can currently see a live demo at: http://webid.fcns.eu/sempb.php

# How it works.

After suppying the form with a source WebID and a destination WebID, the following steps are taken:

* fetching of source WebID profile to obtain the owner's name
* checking that the list of foaf:knows relations in the source WebID profile contains a reference to the destination WebID
* if a match is found, fetching of the destination WebID profile
* if a foaf:mbox relation is found in the destination WebID profile, an email will be sent to the owner of that profile


# Email contents

A typical email will contain the following lines (which can be modified):


-----------
From: <foaf:name of Source WebID> 
WebID: <URI of Source WebID>
Message (optional): <Optional message for the destination user> 
------------


# Dependencies

Apache and PHP

- SemPb currently uses graphite (http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) and ARC2 (https://github.com/semsol/arc2/) PHP libraries for RDF parsing.


# TODO

* [high] add full semantic support! 
* [medium] provide WebID authentication
* [low] add support for additional types of pings (other than email)
