# What is SemPb?

SemPB stands for Semantic Pingback, a service aiming to let users know that someone has added them as friends in their foaf profiles. In order to receive pingbacks, users should add a 'pingback' relation to their profile: 

<pingback:to
        xmlns:pingback='http://purl.org/net/pingback/'
        rdf:resource='http://your-favorite-pingback-service.com/'
        />

As you can see, SemPb is based on the pingback ontology described at http://purl.org/net/pingback/. It is intended to be a service which runs on the same server as the one hosting your WebID profile. SemPb is based on the protocol described at http://www.w3.org/wiki/Pingback.

Right now SemPb transmits pings by email, therefore users should also have a valid foaf:mbox relation if they would like to receive pings. The form used to transmit pingbacks is displayed using RDFa. The main reason is that using a semantic description of the form would allow other services to use this form through RESTful requests (so far only POST). In order for others to identify that this is a pingback endpoint, parsing the form should at least return a triple containing "<> a pingback:Container ."

# How it works.

##Initial configuration

In order to be able to use SemPB, users must first configure the following variables, found in pingback.php:

* $sender = 'pingback@fcns.eu'; // email address to use as source recipient
* $recipient = 'yourname@host.com'; // your email address
* $me = 'http://host.com/people/username/card#me'; // your webid

Now you can receive pingbacks!


## Pingback process
 
After suppying the form with a source WebID, the following steps are taken:

* fetches the source WebID profile to obtain its owner's name
* checks that the list of foaf:knows relations in the source WebID profile contains a reference to the destination WebID
* if a match is found, it sends an email to the address you specified in the initial configuration

# Email contents

A typical email will contain the following lines (which can be modified):


-----------
From: <foaf:name of Source WebID> 
WebID: <URI of Source WebID>
Message (optional): <Optional message for the destination user> 
------------


# Dependencies

Apache and PHP

- SemPb currently uses graphite (http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) and ARC2 (https://github.com/semsol/arc2/) PHP libraries for RDF parsing.


# TODO

* [done] add full semantic support, in conformance to http://www.w3.org/wiki/Pingback 
* [medium] provide WebID authentication
* [low] add support for additional types of pings (other than email)
